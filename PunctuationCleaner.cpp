  PROBLEM STATEMENT
  Some writers like to super-emphasize certain points by using multiple exclamation points instead of one.  For example, "This cheese is really great!!!  I like exclamation points!!!!!!!!"  Other times, writers express surprise by mixing exclamation points and question marks.  For example, "You really like THIS cheese!?!?!?!!!?".
  Â 

  You are editing a document for publication, and you'd like to get rid of some of the extra punctuation.  Wherever you see a group of multiple consecutive exclamation points, replace it with a single exclamation point.  Wherever you see a group of multiple consecutive punctuation characters containing at least one question mark and zero or more exclamation points (and no other characters), replace that group with a single question mark.  See the examples for further clarification.  Return the string after these changes have been made.

  DEFINITION
  Class:PunctuationCleaner
  Method:clearExcess
  Parameters:string
  Returns:string
  Method signature:string clearExcess(string document)


  CONSTRAINTS
  -document will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
  -document will contain only letters ('a'-'z', 'A'-'Z'), spaces (' '), question marks ('?'), and exclamation points ('!').


  EXAMPLES

  0)
  "This cheese is really great!!!!!"

  Returns: "This cheese is really great!"



  1)
  "You really like THIS cheese!?!?!?!!!?"

  Returns: "You really like THIS cheese?"



  2)
  " !!?X! ?? This is delicious!!! ??!a!?!"

  Returns: " ?X! ? This is delicious! ?a?"

  Sometimes writers get very carried away.  Remember to preserve spaces and other characters from the input.
